Part 1
For program part one I tested by making a file of several differnt commands and then using the
javac FileSys.java and then the java FileSys < testfile.txt to input my test file into the FileSys file .
I wrote correct and incorrect program actions in it so that they would give me differnt results . I also tested different "bogus" actions to see if they would run. 
Some of the test cases and their responses will be listed below:
"create" - Please enter valid name - because there was no file name
"create file.txt" -Success 
"cat"-Please enter valid name - because there was no file name 
"pwd" - Success
"rmdir" -Please enter valid name - because there is no directory name to remove
"mkdir"- Please enter valid name - because there is no directory name to make
"find file.txt" - Success 
"Jada"- CMD IS not valid - not a command
"exit" - Goodbye - self explanitory
There are others in my testfile.txt if you would like to look at more that i did 
Also I was not sure if the exit command was supposed to exit the program on part one but that is what it does

Part 2
For part 2 of project one I tested different [arts by different strategies. 
For all of the different directory changes.When ls was made then I would make a new directory , and try to cd into it. Then I would type ls to see if I was in the new directory > I also used pwd after I got it working to really test and see what would work . Here is basically a copy and paste from my command line of what happened.
jadastestcommandline - % mkdir newdir
jadastestcommandline - % ls
newdir (*)     
jadastestcommandline - % mkdir newdir.ps3
jadastestcommandline - % ls
newdir (*)     newdir.ps3 (*)     
jadastestcommandline - % cd newdir
jadastestcommandline - % mkdir findme.txt
jadastestcommandline - % cd /

Also to test the file contents was saving the way it should I did do a lot of System.out.println to see what exactly was happening in the code.
I also used this method in other parts of the code. Pretty much in all of it just to see what was going on.
The test case file does not really work it follows the commands but the spacing ends up a little weird , it works better when someone is actually typing into the command line it has better spacing .
jadastestcommandline - % mkdir directorya directoryb
jadastestcommandline - % ls
directorya directoryb (*)   
This is how the pwd works . It was a lot of trial and error running it and having multiple print statements.
jadastestcommandline - % cd /
jadastestcommandline - % mkdir level1
jadastestcommandline - % cd level1
jadastestcommandline - % mkdir level2
jadastestcommandline - % cd level2
jadastestcommandline - % mkdir level3
jadastestcommandline - % cd level3
jadastestcommandline - % pwd
/level1/level2/level3
jadastestcommandline - %
